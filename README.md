- Using `fetch()` with error handling. 
- Implemented pagination to navigate through multiple pages of results.  
- Environment detection to securely manage API keys.
- Visual effects with CSS.
- Input validation and conditional rendering.
- Applying `text-overflow`, truncating long titles and showing full text on hover.

### ðŸ’» Mini Project: Movie Search App ðŸŽ¬

Web app that allows searching for movies using the OMDb API. Displays dynamic movie cards with visual effects. A great project to practice API consumption and DOM manipulation using OMDb's public API. It features:

- Search input field  
- Dynamic rendering of results  
- Placeholder for missing posters
- Supports both local development and production deployment

ðŸ”‘ API key is handled conditionally via a local `config.js` file only when in development (`localhost`).
